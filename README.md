Keystone is starting place in the construction of web apps. We are still figuring out which direction to take this project, but we plan on it being used as a starting point and a point of reference. You might use this if you have the need of a separate site, yet same url,  for desktop and mobile all depending which device the user is viewing it from.


## Features
 * Launch Image
 * Install to Home Screen page
 * Loading Screen
 * Link stay within the app
 * Looks and acts like a native app


## TODO
 * Look more into [MBP](https://github.com/h5bp/mobile-boilerplate/wiki) help.js and see if we should add it or if it conflicts with the little I have.
 * Think about adding [hook.js](https://github.com/jordansinger/Hook.js)
