Keystone
========

Keystone is starting place in the construction of web apps.

## Features
 * Launch Image
 * Install to Home Screen page
 * Loading Screen
 * Link stay within the app
 * Looks and acts like a native app

## TODO
 * Look more into [MBP](https://github.com/h5bp/mobile-boilerplate/wiki) help.js and see if we should add it or if it conflicts with the little I have.
 * Think about adding [hook.js](https://github.com/jordansinger/Hook.js)
